## STATICFILES
This are the files like CSS, JavaScript, and images that are not dynamically generated and are served as-is to the clientâ€™s browser.
Managing static files correctly is essential for a smooth user experience and improved performance.
Steps to add static files:
- create a directory by the name " static " on the app directory and in it create a directory for css and another one for images.
- On your settings we must make sure the static settings are configured this way:
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') 
- with the root being static files
- after that we use this command to collect all our static files 
[ python manage.py collectfiles ]
- then take option [ yes ] to give permission for the collection of our files and it gives us a notification that files have been
copied to a certain path.
The css in this directory becomes our global styling sheet for all our templates and the content in other files which is the same
with our images and can be used in any html template.
